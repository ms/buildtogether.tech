<p><a section="fairness"/> ended with a list of books about stuff that actually
matters.  The ones below also helped me understand how we got here and why so
many things seem broken.  Like all such lists, it's very personal: I grew up
straight, white, and male in a small town in western Canada fifty years ago, so
you might already know many of the things I needed to be told, or might need to
learn things that I still haven't heard of.  Additions to this list would
therefore be very welcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy</em>
    <cite>McMillanCottom2018</cite>.  Describes how a large part of the
    educational sector in the US exists to translate government grants into
    personal debt for the poor and private profit for the rich.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Owning the Earth</em> <cite>Linklater2013</cite>.  The idea that individuals can
    own land is a lot younger than most people realize, and its emergence holds
    a lot of lessons for today's debates over intellectual property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Seeing Like a State</em> <cite>Scott1999</cite> and <em>Bullshit Jobs: A Theory</em>
    <cite>Graeber2019</cite>.  The first explains why large organizations always
    prefer uniformity over productivity, and the price people pay for this; the
    second explores the proliferation of meaningless busy-work jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Twitter and Tear Gas</em> <cite>Tufekci2018</cite>.  A nuanced look at how social
    media is and isn't changing politics and protest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Spirit Level</em> <cite>Wilkinson2011</cite>.  An evidence-based exploration
    of how and why greater equality is better for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The View From Flyover Country</em> <cite>Kendzior2018</cite> and <em>Hiding in Plain
    Sight</em> <cite>Kendzior2020</cite>.  Essential reading about the rise of
    authoritarian kleptocracy in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>So You Want to Talk About Race</em> <cite>Oluo2019</cite>.  A sharp-edged
    analysis of everyday racism and how to confront it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Great Transformation</em> <cite>Armstrong2007</cite> and <em>Doubt: A History</em>
    <cite>Hecht2004</cite>.  The first book chronicles the critical centuries in
    which Confucianism and Daoism arose in China, Hinduism and Buddhism in
    India, monotheism in the Middle East, and rationalism in Greece; the second
    Traces the evolution of one of the great traditions in Western thought (one
    which even today makes many people uncomfortable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sisters: The Lives of America's Suffragists</em> <cite>Baker2006</cite>.
    Explains history through biography, and does well at both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Building Powerful Community Organizations</em> <cite>Brown2007</cite>.  The best
    practical guide I know to creating and sustaining grassroots groups with a
    purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The World That Never Was</em> <cite>Butterworth2011</cite>.  Explores the early
    days of the anarchist movement, and in doing so shows how governments create
    the villains they need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Trick or Treatment</em> <cite>Singh2009</cite>.  A sceptical (but not hostile)
    look at alternative medicine that is incidentally a great primer on
    standards of evidence and how to interpret scientific findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Four Futures: Life After Capitalism</em> <cite>Frase2016</cite>.  Explores four
    scenarios in which our reactions to increasing automation and worsening
    climate change play out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bury the Chains</em> <cite>Hochschild2006</cite>.  "Slavery was to the nineteenth
    century what oil is today: morally repugnant but economically
    indispensable."  The fight against it was one of the first great triumphs of
    democratic activism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>From the Ruins of Empire</em> <cite>Mishra2013</cite> and <em>Black Wave</em>
    <cite>Ghattas2020</cite>.  The first is three intellectual biographies
    showing how the peoples of Asia responded to the West; the second is a
    history of the struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and how it has shaped
    the history of the last half century.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Last Utopia</em> <cite>Moyn2010</cite>.  Argues that human rights became the
    defining issue for post-war progressives only because others failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Humanizing the Economy</em> <cite>Restakis2010</cite>.  A history of the
    co-operative movement and a blueprint for its future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em> <cite>Mukherjee2011</cite> and <em>How to Survive a
    Plague</em> <cite>France2016</cite>.  The first is a history of cancer and its
    (mis)treatment; the second, of the AIDS crisis and how victims and their
    allies came together when society as a whole let them down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Dictator's Handbook</em> <cite>BuenoDeMesquita2012</cite>.  Presents a
    slightly cynical theory of why bad behavior is often good politics.</p>
</li>
