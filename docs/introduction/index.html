      <p>Three books changed my life as a programmer. [<a href="../bibliography/#Kernighan1981">Kernighan1981</a>] taught
me that I could do more than just write software---I could <em>design</em> it---while
[<a href="../bibliography/#Glass2002">Glass2002</a>] taught me that we could investigate software and software
development scientifically, and by doing so discover what actually works and
what doesn't.</p>
<p>In between those two books I read [<a href="../bibliography/#Hunt1999">Hunt1999</a>], as did many other
programmers of my generation. For many of us, it was the first time someone had
described the craft of software construction in a way that made sense. When I
began supervising undergraduate projects at the University of Toronto in the
early 2000s, I referred to it over and over again.</p>
<p>Looking at it and at its twentieth anniversary edition [<a href="../bibliography/#Thomas2019">Thomas2019</a>],
I am struck by how useful it continues to be, but also by what it <em>doesn't</em>
discuss.  How do you run a meeting in a way that ensures decisions actually get
made and everyone is heard?  After working in tech for forty years, I believe
that is the most important skill I ever learned.  Why and how do tech companies
build products that people don't want? Why do they marginalize women, people of
color, and members of the LGBT community despite all the evidence showing that
more diverse teams are more productive?  And given how online platforms have
fueled radicalization and disinformation in ways that threaten us all, shouldn't
every guide to being a better programmer at least mention the problem?</p>
<p>If you are an undergraduate student embarking on a semester-long software
project as part of a team, this book will give you tools that will help you
succeed.  Some of these are purely technical, like a version control system or
an IDE; others are guidelines to help you form teams, manage people who aren't
pulling their weight, cut features when time runs short, and understand who owns
the things you produce.</p>
<p>Our aim is to teach you how to be a <em>compassionate programmer</em>: one who cares as
much about the well-being of their colleagues and users as they do about their
own.  This focus is not entirely altruistic---everything you do to help others
also helps your future self---but now that we all know how much harm software
can do, we hope you'll be interested in some practical idealism.</p>
<p><em>All proceeds from this project will go to support
the [Red Door Family Shelter][red-door-shelter].</em></p>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>Every lesson should be written with specific learners in mind.  These
<span i="learner persona"><a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas">personas</a></span> are ours:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yanina is in the third year of a computer science degree. She worked on
several volunteer projects in high school and through her mosque, but the
&quot;Introduction to Software Engineering&quot; course she's about to take will be
her first semester-long team project at university. This guide will help her
and her teammates figure out what to do when.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brad is in Yanina's classes. He started programming when he was nine years
old, and as a result can do many practical assignments in half the time it
takes other students (something he attributes to intelligence and aptitude
rather than to his parents being able to afford to send him to after-school
coding camps). He finds any discussion of what he privately called &quot;social
justice bullshit&quot; tiresome; this guide will help him understand why that
attitude is self-defeating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahmadou worked as an illustrator for several years before doing an intensive
14-week conversion course to become a JavaScript developer. He has a lot of
experience working in teams to meet deadlines, but is still often bewildered
by the tools, jargon, and culture of programming. This guide will help him
figure out what his new colleagues think is &quot;normal&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharla teaches JavaScript at Yanina's college and for the conversion course
that Ahmadou went through. They taught the &quot;Introduction to Software
Engineering&quot; class last semester, and felt that they and their students
wasted a lot of time on things that turned out not to be useful. This guide
will help them give more structure to the next offering and set more
realistic expectations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like these personas, readers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be able to write multi-page programs in Java, Python, JavaScript, or some
other modern programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to create static web sites using HTML and CSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know how to create directories, delete files, and find things with the Unix
shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have used <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> on individual projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This book can be read on its own or as a companion to <em><a href="https://stjs.tech/">Software Tools in
JavaScript</a></em>, which teaches the basics of software design by showing you
how to build the tools you program with.  If you are looking for a project to do
in a course, adding a tool to those covered there would be fun as well as
educational.</p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>Life is short and your project is even shorter, so this book focuses on the
handful of tools and techniques that will help you the most in the short and
medium term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to work effectively in a small team when you are constantly being
interrupted by other tasks like the homework for your other courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What tools you should use to build, test, deploy, and describe software
in less time and with less pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to design a program (or a set of related programs) that will take
several weeks to write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How a few simple changes in your study habits will enable you to learn more
and more quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What legal rights you have to the software you create as a student (and on
the job).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we actually know about software development and why we believe it's
true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What to do when things go wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have included other material as well, since there is a lot of variation
between project courses (and even more between the people doing them).
Throughout, we are guided by a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution">Dobzhansky's
Rule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- continue -->
<p>Many of the hard problems in software engineering stem from the fact that human
beings think and feel, and we do those things in certain ways.  Our mental
capacity is limited, which means we have to design programs so that they will
fit into the space between our ears. We learn and work better when we are doing
things that help us meet our personal goals, which means projects will be more
successful if we take motivation into account. And as we learn more, the best
way for us to learn changes in predictable ways, so how we are taught should
change too.</p>

<p>This book is dedicated to <span i="Petre, Marian"><a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/people/mp8">Marian

studying can be measured, and to <span i="Wilkie, Tom">Tom

<p>I have tried to base recommendations on empirical software engineering research
(<a class="secref" href="../research/#research">Chapter&nbsp;22</a>) and on the science of teaching and learning
(<a class="secref" href="../thinking/#thinking">Appendix&nbsp;F</a>). Where those don't have answers, I have drawn on the experience
of the students and programmers mentioned below.  Any errors, omissions, or
misunderstandings that remain are entirely our fault.</p>
