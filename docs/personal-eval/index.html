<p>The material below is adapted from the guidelines for annual performance reviews
at a well-known software development company.  It's an accurate depiction of
what companies care about, and can be used as a starting point for
self-evaluation or peer evaluation in a project course.</p>
<h2>Software Engineering</h2>
<p>Includes technical design; architecture; coding; debugging; testing; performance
optimization; release; and maintenance.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Records technical requirements, architectural decisions, and other relevant information.</dt>
<dd>Does "just enough" design to answer all stakeholders' questions; analyzes
and reviews peers' designs; takes resource usage into account during design;
no "hidden features"; takes security needs into account.</dd>
<dt>Plans for evolution and maintenance.</dt>
<dd>Avoids excessive dependencies; allows for future maintenance; accounts for
deployment issues, particularly upgrades.</dd>
<dt>Uses configuration management system effectively.</dt>
<dd>All project-related material is versioned; never breaks the build; all
changes are connected to issues in an auditable way.</dd>
<dt>Uses issue tracking system effectively.</dt>
<dd>All questions, tasks, and bugs are issues; all work is associated with
issues; issues are kept up to date to serve as a basis for auditable status
reports; avoids creating redundant/duplicate issues.</dd>
<dt>Manages schedule.</dt>
<dd>Provides time estimates on work items, and updates completion estimates as
work progresses; proactively reports delays and other scheduling-related
issues to affected stakeholders; proactively searches for ways to reduce the
project's critical path.</dd>
<dt>Conforms to company coding guidelines.</dt>
<dd>Code always passes format checks; documentation of all inter-module and
externally-visible APIs is always up to date on main branch;
developer-oriented documentation phrased in terms of recognized design
