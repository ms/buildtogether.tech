The things that go wrong most often in software projects have nothing to do with
software.  Instead, the worst mistakes people make are related to the human side
of things. Before we look at teamwork or tools, we need to talk about overwork,
how to run a meeting, and how to resolve arguments.

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

### Not writing software takes less time

<cite>Sedano2017</cite> found that software development projects have nine types
of waste: building the wrong feature or product, mismanaging the backlog,
rework, unnecessarily complex solutions, extraneous cognitive load (<span
x="thinking"></span>), psychological distress, waiting/multitasking, knowledge
loss, and ineffective communication. *None of these are software issues,* so if
you only think about the software side of your project, it's going to take
longer and hurt more than it needs to.

## Crunch Mode

I used to brag about the hours I was working.  Not in so many words, of
course---I had *some* social skills.  Instead, I'd show up for work around noon,
unshaven and yawning, and casually mention how I'd been up until 6:00 a.m.
hacking away at some monster bug.

Looking back, I can't remember who I was trying to impress.  Instead, what I
remember is how much of the code I wrote in those all-nighters I threw away once
I'd had some sleep, and how much damage the bugs I created in those bleary-eyed
stupors did to my teammates' productivity.

My mistake was to confuse "long hours" with "getting things done".  You can't
produce software (or anything else) without doing some work, but you can easily
do lots of work without producing anything of value.  Scientific study of the
issue goes back to at least the 1890s---see <cite>Robinson2005</cite> for a
short, readable summary.  The most important results for developers are:

1.  Working more than eight hours a day for an extended period of time lowers
    your total productivity, not just your hourly productivity---i.e., you get
    less done *in total* (not just per hour) when you're in <span
    g="crunch_mode">crunch mode</span> than you do when you work regular hours.

1.  Working over 21 hours in a stretch increases the odds of you making a
    catastrophic error just as much as being legally drunk.

These facts have been verified through hundreds of experiments over the course
of more than a century, including some on novice software developers
<cite>Fucci2020</cite>.  The data behind them is as solid as the data linking
smoking to lung cancer.  However, while most smokers will acknowledge that their
habit is killing them, people in the software industry still talk and act as if
science somehow didn't apply to them.  To quote Robinson's article:

<blockquote markdown="1">

When Henry Ford famously adopted a 40-hour workweek in 1926, he was bitterly
criticized by members of the National Association of Manufacturers.  But his
experiments, which he'd been conducting for at least 12 years, showed him
clearly that cutting the workday from ten hours to eight hours---and the
workweek from six days to five days---increased total worker output and
reduced production cost…  the core of his argument was that reduced shift
length meant more output.

…many studies, conducted by businesses, universities, industry associations
and the military, …support the basic notion that, for most people, eight
hours a day, five days per week, is the best sustainable long-term balance
point between output and exhaustion.  Throughout the 30s, 40s, and 50s, these
studies were apparently conducted by the hundreds; and by the 1960s, the
benefits of the 40-hour week were accepted almost beyond question in corporate
America.  In 1962, the Chamber of Commerce even published a pamphlet extolling
the productivity gains of reduced hours.

But, somehow, Silicon Valley didn't get the memo…

</blockquote>

I was part of a data visualization startup in the mid-1990s.  Three months
before our first release, the head of development "asked" us to start coming in
on Saturdays.  We were already pulling one late night a week at that point
(without overtime pay---our boss seemed to think that ten dollars' worth of
pizza was adequate compensation for four hours of work) and most of us were also
working at least a couple of hours at home in the evenings.  It's hardly
surprising that we missed our "can't miss" deadline by ten weeks, and had to
follow up our 1.0 release with a 1.1 and then a 1.2 in order to patch the
crash-and-lose-data bugs we'd created.  We were all zombies, and zombies can't
code.

Those kinds of hours are sadly still normal in many parts of the software
industry.  Everyone knows that designing and building software is a creative act
that requires a clear head, but many people then act as if it was like digging a
ditch.  The big difference is that it's hard to lose ground when digging (though
not impossible).  In software, on the other hand, it's very easy to go backward.
It only takes me a couple of minutes to create a bug that will take hours to
track down later---or days, if someone else is unlucky enough to have to track
it down.  This is summarized in Robinson's first rule:

<blockquote markdown="1">

Productivity varies over the course of the workday, with the greatest
productivity occurring in the first four to six hours.  After enough hours,
productivity approaches zero; eventually it becomes negative.

</blockquote>

It's hard to quantify the productivity of programmers, testers, and UI
designers, but five eight-hour days per week has been proven to maximize
long-term total output in every industry that has ever been studied. There is no
reason to believe that ours is any different.

Ah, you say, that's "long-term total output".  What about short bursts now and
then, like pulling an all-nighter to meet a deadline?  That's been studied too,
and the results aren't pleasant.  Your ability to think drops by 25% for each 24
hours you're awake.  Put it another way, the average person's IQ is only 75
after one all-nighter, which puts them in the bottom 5% of the population.  Two
all nighters in a row and their effective IQ is 50---the level at which people
are usually judged incapable of independent living.

The catch in all of this is that people usually don't notice their abilities
declining.  Just like drunks who think they're still able to drive, people who
are deprived of sleep don't realize that they're not finishing their sentences
(or thoughts).  They certainly don't realize that they're passing parameters
into function calls the wrong way around or that the reason the tests are
failing is that they've forgotten to redeploy the application again.

The moral of this story is to think very hard about what's more important to
you---how much good work you produce or how much of a martyr you appear to
be---and pace yourself accordingly.

## Time Management

"But I have so many assignments to do!", you say.  "And they're all due at once!
I *have* to work extra hours to get them all done!" Sadly, that is often true:
while people in industry joke that having two bosses means living in hell, most
students can only dream of having just two, since most schools do a lousy job of
coordinating due dates across differences courses.  <cite>Tregubov2017</cite>
found, there is strong correlation between the number of projects and the number
of interruptions that developers reported.

The best strategy for managing this situation is to prioritize and focus.
Prioritizing is important because most of us are very good at spending hours on
things that don't need to be done and then finding themselves with too little
time for the things that actually count. A little bit of organizing can help a
lot---as <cite>Mark2008</cite> reported, "…people compensate for interruptions
by working faster, but this comes at a price: experiencing more stress, higher
frustration, time pressure and effort."

Make a list of the things you have to do.
:   I still use a hardcover lab notebook for this so that I can doodle in it
    when I'm thinking, but a lot of people keep a personal wiki or send
    themselves email messages that then go into a folder titled "To Do".
    However you do it, the important thing is to *write it all down*.  You can
    only keep a handful of things in short-term memory at once (<span
    x="thinking"></span>); if you try to manage a to-do list longer than that in
    your head, you will forget things.

Weed out everything that you don't need to do right away.
:   If you want to try out a new editor theme that's play time not work time,
    and we're talking about getting work done.

Sort the list so that the most important tasks are at the top.
:   I don't worry about getting the stuff below the first three or four lines
    into order, since I'm going to re-check my list before I get to them anyway.

Make sure you have everything you need to see the first task through.
:   The most recent files from version control (<span x="using-git"></span>),
    the assignment specification, a fresh cup of tea---whatever it is, don't
    give yourself an excuse to interrupt your work, because the world will
    provide enough of those.

Turn off interruptions.
:   Shut down your mail client, instant messaging, and your cell phone.  Don't
    panic, it's only for an hour---most people can't stay focused longer than
    that, and you'll need to stretch your muscles and get rid of that tea you
    drank by then anyway.

Set an alarm to go off in fifty minutes.
:   Don't switch tasks in that time unless you absolutely have to.  Instead, if
    you remember an email message that needs to be sent or discover a couple of
    tests that really should be written, add a note to your to-do list.  This is
    another reason I keep mine in a lab notebook: the few seconds it takes to
    pick up a pen and jot something down gives my hands a rest from the
    keyboard, and I'm less likely to be distracted by a notebook than by a text
    editor.

Take a ten-minute break.
:   Get up and move around a little during these ten minutes, even if it's just
    to refill your water bottle, visit the toilet, or do a few stretches. You
    will be able to work longer if your back doesn't ache, and being away from
    the keyboard for a few minutes gives your brain a chance to reflect on what
    you've just been doing. (It's amazing how often a problem that has baffled
    me for an hour can be solved by a five-minute walk.) When you're done,
    check that your to-do list is still in the right order and start again.

If any task on your list is more than an hour long, break it down into into
smaller pieces and prioritize those separately.  And keep in mind that the
future is approaching at a fixed rate of one day every 24 hours: if something's
going to take sixty hours to do you had better allow at least ten working days
for it, which means you'd better tackle the first piece two working weeks before
the deadline.  Since breaking large tasks down into small ones takes time, don't
be surprised if "plan XYZ" appears as a task in your list.

The point of all this organization and preparation is to get yourself into the
most productive mental state possible.  <cite>Csikszentmihalyi1991</cite>
popularized the term "flow" for this; athletes call it "being in the zone",
while musicians talk about losing themselves in what they're playing.  Whatever
name you use, you will produce much more in this state than normal.

The bad news is that it takes anywhere from several seconds to several minutes
to get back into a productive flow after an interruption
<cite>Parnin2010,Borst2015</cite>.  This means that if you are interrupted half
a dozen times per hour you are *never* at your productive peak. Ironically, the
cost of self-interruptions may be even worse than the cost for external
interruptions <cite>Abad2018</cite>.  It's very much like processes being paged
in and out by an operating system: if it happens too often, the CPU spends all
its time moving things around and none doing useful work.

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

### How bad is it?

A student of mine kept a stopwatch beside his computer for a couple of weeks
during term.  Every time he read mail, put Twitter in the foreground, or went
to Manchester United's web site he hit the button to stop it.  At the end of
two weeks he discovered that he only spent 28% of his "working" time working. 
Put it another way, he could have finished his assignments in a third of the
time they actually took.

</div>

Making lists and setting 50-minute alarms will seem a little earnest at first,
but your friends will stop mocking you when they see that you're able to finish
your assignments and still have time to play some badminton and catch a movie.
They may even start to imitate you.

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

### Open offices suck

Open offices were created so that (mostly male) managers could keep an eye on
(mostly female) office workers, and to reduce air conditioning costs
<cite>Eley1995</cite>.  In every other way we can measure, they lower
productivity <cite>Bernstein2018</cite>.

</div>

## Meetings

The previous section explained how to be productive individually---what about
being productive in a team? <span x="teams"></span> will explore this subject,
but the single most important thing is knowing how to run a meeting efficiently.
The rules doing so are simple but rarely followed:

Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting.
:   If the only purpose is to share information, have everyone send a brief
    email instead.  Most people can read faster than they can speak: if someone
    has facts for the rest of the team to absorb, the most polite way to
    communicate them is to type them in.

Write an agenda.
:   If nobody cares enough about the meeting to prepare a point-form list of
    what's to be discussed, the meeting probably doesn't need to happen.  Note
    that "the agenda is all the open issues in our GitHub repo" doesn't count.

Include timings in the agenda.
:   Doing this helps prevent early items stealing time from later ones.  The
    first estimates with any new group are inevitably optimistic, so expect to
    revise them upward for subsequent meetings.  But don't have second or third
    meeting just because the first one ran over time: instead, try to figure out
    *why* it ran over and fix the underlying problem.

Prioritize.
:   Tackle issues that will have high impact but take little time first, and
    things that will take more time but have less impact later.  That way the
    meeting will still have accomplished something if the first items run over
    time.

Make one person responsible for keeping things moving.
:   One person should be made moderator and be responsible for keeping items to
    time, chiding people who are having side conversations or checking email,
    and asking people who are talking too much to get to the point.  The
    moderator should *not* do all the talking: in fact, whoever is in charge
    will talk less in a well-run meeting than most other participants.

Require politeness.
:   No one gets to be rude, no one gets to ramble, and if someone goes off
    topic, it's the moderator's job to say, "Let's discuss that elsewhere."

No interruptions.
:   Participants should raise a finger, hand, put up a sticky note, or make
    another well understood gesture to indicate when they want to speak.  The
    moderator should keep track of who wants to speak and give them time in
    turn.

No distractions.
:   Side conversations make meetings less efficient because nobody can actually
    pay attention to two things at once.  Similarly, if someone is checking
    their email or texting a friend during a meeting, it's a clear signal that
    they don't think the speaker or their work is important.  This doesn't mean
    a complete ban on technology---people may need accessibility aids, or may be
    waiting for a call from a dependent---but by default, phones should be face
    down and laptops should be closed during in-person meetings.

Take minutes.
:   Someone other than the moderator should take point-form notes about the most
    important information that was shared, and about every decision that was
    made or every task that was assigned to someone.  This should be a rotating
    duty among members.

End early.
:   If the meeting is scheduled for 10:00--11:00, aim to end at 10:50 to give
    people a break before whatever they're doing next.

As soon as the meeting is over, email the minutes to everyone or add a text file
to the project's wiki, version control repository, or wherever else things are
being stored:

People who weren't at the meeting can follow what's going on.
:   We all have to juggle tasks from several projects or courses, which means
    that sometimes we can't make it to meetings.  Checking a written record is a
    more accurate and efficient way to catch up than asking a colleague, "What
    did I miss?"

Everyone can check what was actually said or promised.
:   More than once, I have looked over a set of minutes and thought, "Did I say
    that?" or, "I didn't promise to have it ready then!"  Accidentally or not,
    people often remember things differently; writing them down gives everyone a
    chance to correct mistakes, misinterpretations, or misrepresentations.

People can be held accountable at subsequent meetings.
:   There's no point making lists of questions and action items if you don't
    follow up on them later.  If you are using an issue-tracking system (<span
    x="tooling"></span>), create an issue for each new question or task right
    after the meeting and update those that are being carried forward.  This
    helps a lot when the time comes to draw up the agenda for the next meeting.

### Are you a blowfish or a clam?

[NOAA's guide][noaa-disruptive] to dealing with disruptive behaviors has useful
labels and even more useful advice for handling people who may send meetings off
course.

</div>

If you would like to become better at sharing information and making decisions,
there is no better place to start than <cite>Brookfield2016</cite>. This book
catalogs fifty different techniques and explains when and why each is useful.

## Air Time

One of the problems in a synchronous meeting is the tendency of some people to
speak far more than others.  Other meeting members may be so accustomed to this
that they don't speak up even when they have valuable points to
make.

One way to combat this is to give everyone three sticky notes (or coins, or
paperclips---anything inedible will do).  at the start of the meeting.  Every
time they speak, they have to give up one sticky note.  When they're out of
stickies, they aren't allowed to speak until everyone has used at least one, at
which point everyone gets all of their sticky notes back.  This ensures that
nobody talks more than three times as often as the quietest person in the
meeting, and completely changes group dynamics.  People who have given up trying
to be heard suddenly have space to contribute, and the overly frequent speakers
realize how unfair they have been.

Another useful technique is called interruption bingo.  Draw a grid and label
the rows and columns with the participants' names.  Each time one person
interrupts another, add a tally mark to the appropriate cell; halfway through
the meeting, take a moment to look at the results.  In most cases it will be
clear that one or two people are doing all of the interrupting.  After that,
saying, "All right, I'm adding another tally to the bingo card," is often enough
to get them to throttle back.

Online meetings provide special challenges, both in the context of regulating
how often individuals speak, as well as running meetings in general.
<cite>Troy2018</cite> discusses why online meetings are often frustrating and
unproductive and points out that in most online meetings, the first person to
speak during a pause gets the floor.  As a result, "If you have something you
want to say, you have to stop listening to the person currently speaking and
instead focus on when they're gonna pause or finish so you can leap into that
nanosecond of silence and be the first to utter something.  The
format…encourages participants who want to contribute to say more and listen
less."

The solution is to run a text chat beside the video conference where people can
signal that they want to speak.  The moderator can then select people from the
waiting list.  This practice can be reinforced by having everyone mute
themselves, and only allowing the moderator to unmute people.

## Making Decisions

The purpose of a meeting is to make decisions, so sooner or later, the members
of a project must decide who has a say in what.  The first step is to
acknowledge that every team has a power structure: the question is whether it's
formal or informal---in other words, whether it's accountable or unaccountable
<cite>Freeman1972</cite>.  The latter can work for groups of up to half a dozen
people in which everyone knows everyone else.  Beyond that, groups need to spell
out who has the authority to make which decisions and how to achieve consensus.
In short, they need explicit <span g="governance">governance</span>.

<span g="marthas_rules">Martha's Rules</span> are a practical way to do this in
groups with up to a few dozen members <cite>Minahan1986</cite>, and work very
well for smaller teams too:

1.  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal.  Proposals
    must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered
    at that meeting, and must include:
    -   a one-line summary
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any required background information
    -   pros and cons
    -   possible alternatives

2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are
    present.

3.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.  The
    group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their
    delegate is present.  The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the
    item to the group.

4.  After the sponsor presents the proposal a <span g="sense_vote">sense
    vote</span> is cast for the proposal prior to any discussion:
    -   Who likes the proposal?
    -   Who can live with the proposal?
    -   Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?

5.  If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal, it passes with no
    further discussion.

6.  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is sent back to
    its sponsor for further work.  (The sponsor may decide to drop it if it's
    clear that the majority isn't going to support it.)

7.  If some members are uncomfortable with the proposal, a timer is set for a
    brief discussion moderated by the meeting moderator.  After 10 minutes or
    when no one has anything further to add, the moderator calls for a straight
    yes-or-no vote on the question: "Should we implement this decision over the
    stated objections?"  If a majority votes "yes" the proposal is implemented.
    Otherwise, it is returned to the sponsor for further work.

Every group that uses Martha's Rules must make two procedural decisions:

How are proposals put forward?
:   The easiest way do do this in a software project is to file an issue in the
    project's issue tracker tagged *Proposal*.  Team members can then comment on
    the proposal, and the sponsor can revise it before bringing it to a vote.

Who gets to vote?
:   In a course project the answer is "whoever is part of the team," but if the
    project grows and attracts volunteer contributors, a more explicit rule is
    needed.  One common method is for existing members to nominate new ones,
    and for the team to hold a straight yes-or-no vote on each.

Rules that people don't know about can't help them.  Once your team agrees on a
project structure, a workflow, how to get items on a meeting agenda, or how to
make decisions, you should document this for newcomers (and to prevent disputes
among people already in the team).  This information may be included as a
section in the project's `README` file (<span x="using-git"></span>) or put
into a separate file called `CONTRIBUTING`.  This material should describe the
naming conventions to use for functions, what tags to put on issues, or how to
install and configure the software needed to start work on the project.
Wherever it goes, remember that the easier it is for people to get set up, the
more likely they are to contribute <cite>Steinmacher2014</cite>.

## Conflict

You just missed an important deadline, and people are unhappy.  The sick feeling
in the pit of your stomach has turned to anger: you did *your* part, but Sylvie
didn't finish her stuff until the very last minute, which meant that no one else
had time to spot the two big mistakes she'd made.  As for Cho, he didn't deliver
at all---again.  If something doesn't change, you're not going to pass this
course.

Conflicts like this come up all the time.  We can deal with them in four ways:

1.  Cross our fingers and hope that things will get better on their own, even
    though they didn't the last three times.

2.  Do extra work to make up for others' shortcomings.  This strategy avoids the
    stress of confronting others in the short run, but the time for that "extra"
    has to come from somewhere.  Sooner or later, our personal lives or other
    responsibilities will suffer.

3.  Lose our temper.  People often displace anger into other parts of their
    lives: they may yell at someone for taking an extra few seconds to make
    coffee when what they really need to do is tell their teammates that they
    aren't going to miss another dinner with their family in order to clean up a
    mess that someone else made.

4.  Take constructive steps to fix the underlying problem.

Most of us find the first option easiest, even though it doesn't fix the
problem.  The fourth option is harder because we don't like confrontation.
Managed properly, though, it can be much less bruising, which means that we
don't have to be as afraid of it.  And if people believe that we will take steps
when they lie, bully, procrastinate, or do a half-assed job, they will often
avoid making it necessary.

Make sure we are not guilty of the same sin.
:   We won't get very far complaining about someone else interrupting in
    meetings if we do it just as frequently.

Check expectations.
:   Are we sure the offender knows what standards they are supposed to be meeting?
    This is where things like the team contracts described in <span
    x="teams"></span> come in handy.

Check the situation.
:   Is someone dealing with an ailing parent or immigration woes?  Do they have
    deadlines for three other projects that we don't know about?  Use open
    questions like, "Can you help me understand this?" when checking in.  This
    gives them the freedom to explain something you may not have expected, and
    avoids the pressure of being asked directly about something they don't want
    to discuss.

Document the offense.
:   Write down what the offender has actually done and why it's not good enough.
    Doing this helps us clarify what we're upset about and is absolutely
    necessary if we have to escalate.

Check with other team members.
:   Are we alone in feeling that the offender is letting the team down?  If so,
    we aren't necessarily wrong, but it'll be a lot easier to fix things if we
    have the support of the rest of the team.  Finding out who else on the team
    is unhappy can be the hardest part of the whole process, since we can't even
    ask the question without letting on that we are upset and word will almost
    certainly get back to whoever we are asking about, who might then accuse us
    of stirring up trouble.

Talk with the offender.
:   This should be a team effort: put it on the agenda for a meeting, present
    the complaint, and make sure that the offender understands it.  This is
    sometimes enough to solve the problem: if someone realizes that they're
    going to be called out for doing sloppy work, they will usually change their
    ways.

Escalate as soon as there's a second offense.
:   People who don't have good intentions count on us giving them one last
    chance after another until the project is finished and they can go suck the
    life out of their next victim.  *Don't fall into this trap.*  If someone
    stole a laptop, we would report it right away.  If someone steals time, we
    are being foolish if we give them a chance to do it again and again.

In a course project, "escalation" means "taking the issue to the instructor".
Of course, they have probably had dozens of students complain to them over the
years about teammates not doing their share, and it isn't uncommon to have both
halves of a pair say that they're doing all the work.  (This is yet another
reason to use version control: it makes it easy to check who's actually written
what.)  In order to get them to take us seriously and help us fix our problem,
we should send them an email signed by several people that describes the problem
and the steps we have already taken to resolve it.  Make sure the offender gets
a copy as well, and ask the instructor to arrange a meeting to resolve the
issue.

One technique your instructor may ask you to use in a meeting of this kind is
<span g="active_listening">active listening</span>. When one person makes a
point, the person on the other side of the issue explains it back to them, as
in, "So what I think Igor is saying is…" This confirms that the second person
has actually paid attention to what the first person said. It can also defuse a
lot of tension, since explaining your position back to you clearly forces the
other person to see the world through your eyes, if only for a few moments.

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

### Hitchhikers

<span g="hitchhiker">Hitchhikers</span> who show up but never actually do
anything are particularly difficult to manage, in part because they are usually
very good at appearing reasonable.  They will nod as we present our case, then
say, "Well, yes, but…" and list a bunch of minor exceptions or cases where
others on the team have also fallen short of expectations.  Tracking progress
and contributions is essential for handling them.  If we can't back up our
complaint, our instructor will likely be left with the impression that the whole
team is dysfunctional.

</div>

What can we do if conflict becomes more personal and heated?

1.  Be short, simple, and firm.

2.  Don't try to be funny.  It almost always backfires, or will later be used
    against us.

3.  Play for the audience.  We probably won't change the person we are calling
    out, but we might change the minds or strengthen the resolve of people who
    are observing.

4.  Pick our battles.  We can't challenge everyone, every time, without
    exhausting ourselves and deafening our audience.  An occasional sharp retort
    will be much more effective than constant criticism.

5.  Don't shame or insult one group when trying to help another.  For example,
    don't call someone stupid when what we really mean is that they're racist or
    homophobic.

and [Charles' Rules of Argument][charles-rules] are very useful online.

Finally, it's important to recognize that good principles sometimes conflict
<cite>Berlin2000</cite>.  For example, suppose that a student has a medically
diagnosed attention disorder that requires them to talk to themselves quite
loudly while programming in order to stay focused, but other members of their
team find this very distracting.  Asking the student in question to program
somewhere else would be punishing them for something they can't control, while
asking everyone else to put on headphones would make their interaction more
difficult and their work less fun.  There might not be a solution that satisfies
everyone; in such cases, the best guide is to do the kindest thing possible.
