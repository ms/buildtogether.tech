We have come a long way since we talked about crunch mode and how to run a
meeting in <a section="important"/>.  Using feature branches, triaging issues,
designing software so that it can be tested---good developers do all of these
things, and learning how to do them yourself will help you get more done in less
time and with less pain.

But good developers know that programming well isn't enough: if you work
yourself to exhaustion, build the wrong thing, or shut people out of discussion,
you project may fail despite all the code you write.  You can learn how to run
meetings, share ideas, base your opinions on the best available research, and
protect people's rights in exactly the same way that you can learn how to use a
debugger; I hope you will choose to do so.

I also hope that your journey won't stop here.  <span i="surveillance">Pervasive
surveillance</span>, online <span i="harassment">harassment</span>, <span
i="radicalization">radicalization</span>, and the <span
i="inequality">concentration of wealth and power</span> in a few unaccountable
hands (or algorithms): our industry has fueled them all, and being a programmer
won't make you immune to the fallout.  None of us can fix this alone; if you
have learned a little from this book about how to work well with others, I hope
you will choose to use those skills to make the world a slightly better place.
If you choose to do so, <a section="rules-change"/> may help.
