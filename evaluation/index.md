These two guides can be used to start discussion about how to evaluate your project,
your team,
and yourself.

## Project Health

Let's see how you're doing.  Give yourself 1 for each "yes", 0 for each "no",
and -1 for "I don't know" or "I don't understand the question".

1.  Does your project have a Code of Conduct and does everyone follow it?

1.  Does your project have a vision statement and does everyone know what it is?

1.  Does every meeting start with an agenda and end with minutes filed somewhere findable?

1.  Is every project resource saved in version control?

1.  Can you rebuild and deploy your project with a single command?

1.  Do you write tests at the same time as you write code?

1.  Do you always run your tests before checking changes into version control?

1.  Do you have a bug database and have you triaged it recently?

1.  Do you use assertions and other defensive programming techniques?

1.  Do you use a symbolic debugger to track problems down?

1.  Do you embed your documentation in your code?

1.  Is there a searchable archive of discussions about the project?

1.  Do you use a style checker to maintain code quality?

1.  Do you do development in a distraction-free environment?

1.  Do you work steadily, without all-nighters or last-minute panic sessions?

How did you do?

-   5 or less: your project will probably fail to deliver anything useful.

-   6--10: most mature development teams are in this range and can bootstrap
    other improvements they need on their own.

-   11 or higher: if you're looking for a job, please let me know.

## In the Real World

The material below is adapted from the guidelines for annual performance reviews
at a well-known software development company.  It's an accurate depiction of
what companies care about.

### Software engineering

Includes technical design; architecture; coding; debugging; testing; performance
optimization; release; and maintenance.

Records technical requirements, architectural decisions, and other relevant information.
:   Does "just enough" design to answer all stakeholders' questions; analyzes
    and reviews peers' designs; takes resource usage into account during design;
    no "hidden features"; takes security needs into account.

Plans for evolution and maintenance.
:   Avoids excessive dependencies; allows for future maintenance; accounts for
    deployment issues, particularly upgrades.

Uses configuration management system effectively.
:   All project-related material is versioned; never breaks the build; all
    changes are connected to issues in an auditable way.

Uses issue tracking system effectively.
:   All questions, tasks, and bugs are issues; all work is associated with
    issues; issues are kept up to date to serve as a basis for auditable status
    reports; avoids creating redundant/duplicate issues.

Manages schedule.
:   Provides time estimates on work items, and updates completion estimates as
    work progresses; proactively reports delays and other scheduling-related
    issues to affected stakeholders; proactively searches for ways to reduce the
    project's critical path.

Conforms to company coding guidelines.
:   Code always passes format checks; documentation of all inter-module and
    externally-visible APIs is always up to date on main branch;
    developer-oriented documentation phrased in terms of recognized design
    patterns where relevant.

## Communication

Includes verbal communication; written reports; presentations; email; wikis;
blogs; active listening skills; feedback and critiques.

Effectively communicates with peers and stakeholders in a
:   Regular and timely fashion.  collaborates regularly with colleagues from
    other divisions; updates manager and team regularly and accurately on
    status.

Asks for assistance when needed.
:   Seeks answers before asking for assistance, but escalates problems when
    blocked; when asking for help, clearly and accurately explains what has been
    tried, and why it didn't work.

Provides helpful feedback to peers.
:   Takes active role in design meetings, code reviews, etc.; provides specific
    examples and suggestions for improvement when critiquing colleagues' work.

Improves efficiency.
:   Automates repetitive tasks through scripts, macros, etc.; proactively does
    in-phase work that will reduce time and overhead in subsequent work phases.

Proactively expands network of personal contacts.
:   Participates in relevant internal discussion groups; takes initiative to
    establish contacts with colleagues in upstream and downstream groups.

## Domain expertise

Includes sharing knowledge; innovating; continued development of personal
skills.

Proactively shares knowledge with peers.
:   Mentoring; blogging tips and tricks; updating project wiki; provides
    training.

Looks for opportunities to innovate.
:   Willing to import relevant knowledge from other groups/projects/companies;
    stays current with relevant literature; proposes and pursues patents.

Actively improves expertise.
:   Attends training courses; seeks to understand goals and techniques of
    upstream and downstream groups; proactively adopts good practices used by
    peers.

## Leadership

Includes communicating vision to peers and subordinates; fostering a supportive
environment; taking a "big picture" view of product development.

Takes part in team-building activities.
:   Interviews potential hires; helps orient new hires; communicates
    consistently with subordinates regarding their status and performance; takes
    part in out-of-hours social events.

Solves problems proactively and methodically.
:   Identifies risks; prioritizes outstanding issues; looks for
    low-cost/low-risk ways to solve or avoid problems; prefers "win-win"
    solutions to "zero-sum" solutions.

Uses metrics for process improvement.
:   Measures and records development times, memory/CPU loads, etc.; translates
    this data into recommendations for process and/or product improvement.

Contributes to project planning.
:   Participates in post mortems; evaluates feasibility of design and feature
    proposals; explains technical issues/opportunities to upstream and
    downstream colleagues.
