  "Frequency Distribution of Error Messages".

      Which programming error messages are the most common? We
      investigate this question, motivated by writing error
      explanations for novices. We consider large data sets in Python
      and Java that include both syntax and run-time errors. In both
      data sets, after grouping essentially identical messages, the
      error message frequencies empirically resemble Zipf-Mandelbrot
      distributions. We use a maximum-likelihood approach to fit the
      distribution parameters. This gives one possible way to contrast
      languages or compilers quantitatively.

<p>
  Based on <a href="http:// daveagp.github.io/errors">a large corpus of error messages</a>,
  the 5 most common errors in Python programs are:
<p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <td>179624</td>
    <td>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>97186</td>
    <td>NameError: name ’NAME’ is not defined</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>76026</td>
    <td>EOFError: EOF when reading a line</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>26097</td>
    <td>SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20758</td>
    <td>IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  and the 5 most common in Java are:
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <td>702102</td>
    <td>cannot find symbol - variable NAME</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>407776</td>
    <td>’;’ expected</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>280874</td>
    <td>cannot find symbol - method NAME</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>197213</td>
    <td>cannot find symbol - class NAME</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>183908</td>
    <td>incompatible types</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  What's more,
  their frequency has a power law (or "long tail") distribution,
  which suggests that improving reporting for just a handful of errors
  would have a disproportionate effect on usability.
  But my favorite part of this paper comes toward the end of Section 3.2:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Can this [relationship] be plausible: is the total number of
  possible errors infinite? We will accept this as a reasonable
  hypothesis...
</blockquote>
<p>
  to which I can only say, "Amen."
