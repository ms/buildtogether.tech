<blockquote>
  Software testing is one of the key activities to software quality in
  practice. Despite its importance, however, we have a remarkable lack
  of knowledge on how developers test in real-world projects. In this
  paper, we report on the surprising results of a large-scale field
  study with 2,443 software engineers whose development activities we
  closely monitored over the course of 2.5 years in four Integrated
  Development Environments (IDEs). Our findings question several
  commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about developer testing:
  half of the developers in our study does not test; developers rarely
  run their tests in the IDE; only once they start testing, do they do
  it heftily; most programming sessions end without any test
  execution; only a quarter of test cases is responsible for three
  quarters of all test failures; 12% of tests show flaky behavior;
  Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not widely practiced; and software
  developers only spend a quarter of their time engineering tests,
  whereas they think they test half of their time. We observed only
  minor differences in the testing practices among developers in
  different IDEs, Java, and C#. We summarize these practices of
  loosely guiding ones development efforts with the help of testing as
  Test-Guided Development (TGD).
