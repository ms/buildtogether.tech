We know applying to jobs can be stressful and we want to ease the stress by
giving clear expectations up front about what to expect from our process. Read
on to learn more about how we hire developers.

## Guiding Principles

**Our process is fair and inclusive.** People from different backgrounds, with
different identities and experiences, help make our products better – just as
our users come from everywhere, a diverse staff helps ensure that we create
products that are accessible to a wide range of people. And it all starts with
Automatticians.

[Unconscious biases][ucsf-unconscious-bias] are real, so our interviewers
actively seek to make our process less biased and more fair through:

-   Training: We've found Facebook's course on Managing Bias and Google's workshop
    on Unconscious Bias @ Work to be quite effective. [Editor's note: given those
    companies' recent records, I would recommend other resources.]

-   Using a standardized hiring rubric to ensure objectivity, fairness, and
    consistency.

-   Documenting our hiring decisions with written evidence structured around the
    specific qualities we're looking for.

**Our process is enjoyable and a learning opportunity.** Our second most
important goal, in addition to finding great new Automatticians, is to be the
best Automattic ambassadors there are. This means:

-   We are unfailingly kind to candidates, no matter their skill level,
    attitude, stage in the hiring process, or our final decision.

-   We provide timely, clear, and honest communication and feedback to
    candidates, as well as access to our people for any questions and concerns.

-   We never miss an opportunity to share the Automattic story: how we do
    things, what our mission is, and why it's a great place to work.

At the end of the process we hope that candidates have learned something about
Automattic, about programming, and/or about themselves; and feel that their
experience was instructive and worthwhile---no matter the outcome.

**We give people the courtesy of a quick response.** We ensure transparency
throughout the process and will always seek to provide quick, timely feedback
and to move people through the process as efficiently as possible.

## Our Hiring Process

When you apply and are selected for an interview at Automattic, it kicks off a
four-part process conducted via Slack, GitHub, and P2s [Editor's note: a
collaboration tool]. It gives you (and us) a chance to see what it would be like
if you worked here – and it means that by the time you're hired, you're familiar
with how we do things and can hit the ground running.

1. Interview.
:   Interviews are conducted via Slack---they're text-only. That's how we work
    day-to-day, so we want to interact with you in that medium. The initial
    interview is a 90-minute chat (which we've found is the equivalent of a
    60-minute face-to-face interview) with an engineer, which covers subjects
    like motivation, technical depth, problem solving, and managing
    complexity. You'll have plenty of opportunity to ask questions, too.

2.  Coding challenge.
:   If the interview goes well, the next stage is a take-home coding challenge
    with a near-real-world piece of code that closely replicates our normal
    work. We use it to evaluate your abilities around security, performance, and
    problem solving, as well as how you communicate and adapt to an unfamiliar
    codebase.
    <br/>
    This exercise should take no more than 4-6 hours of actual coding time. We
    generally allow a week to complete this stage, though it's fine if you need
    more time---just let us know. We timebox this part of the process so that
    you have clear expectations around how much time to spend, and because we
    know that you have other obligations in your life. Unlike a whiteboarding
    interview, you can do this at your own pace and with your own tools.

3.  Trial.
:   Here's where you really get to see what it's like to work at Automattic.
    Trial projects help both of us to determine mutual compatibility and let us
    evaluate your work, communication, and effectiveness. This work is paid,
    part-time, and designed to last between two and eight weeks, for a total of
    around 40 hours of work. This is very flexible, and we'll craft it to work
    with your schedule---both when you can start and what your availability
    is. If you're able to work full-time on the project, great. If you can only
    work two hours on alternate Tuesdays, that's fine, too.

4.  Offer.
    This is the point at which we discuss salary and start date. We can be very
    flexible about start dates, in order to accommodate things like notice to
    previous employers or time off prior to commencing employment with
    Automattic.
