## Have an Exit Strategy

We'll end this section with some advice from a former student:

<blockquote markdown="1">

One final thing I would have loved if someone told me when I was in fourth year:
Have an exit strategy

Your employer is not beholden to you…  Whoever owns/manages the project can toss
your work when you leave (or before) and have it rewritten five times by
different teams…and if you're not careful then there is nothing you can do about
it. This kind of existential loss of many months of genuine effort is a big
component of burnout, too.

My favourite way to mitigate this, which I thankfully learned before my first
job: spend more time designing reusable components outside of the core
task---bonus points if they're open source. Even if your project gets
cancelled…you'll always have those reusable components to support your other
projects and ambitions.

I built [redacted] to solve a larger problem at [redacted], and my effort
continued to provide disproportional value to myself and society long after I
left.  I've always been hedging my efforts this way since, and I'm always glad I
did.
