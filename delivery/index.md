In most courses, once you've handed in an assignment you're done with it. Course
projects are different: they often roll forward from one term to the next, so
the end of one team's involvement isn't necessarily the end of the project, and
they are meant to simulate real life, where delivery of a particular version is
just another step in the product lifecycle.  This chapter describes some things
you might be asked to do during your project or at its end; even if you're not
asked, most of them are worth doing.

At a bare minimum, your project should finish with:

1.  An attractive home page with an elevator pitch and a few paragraphs or
    bullet lists to help newcomers orient themselves.

1.  An architectural overview, including a block diagram of the major components
    and a walkthrough of the processing cycle.

1.  An installation guide.

1.  An up-to-date set of issues. If the work has been done, the issue should be
    closed; if it hasn't, the issue should describe the state of the bug (or
    enhancement, or question) well enough for someone to know where to start
    work.

### Finish with a package

An alternative deliverable is a package that other people can download and
install. It isn't an either/or choice: every good package has a home page, a
design description, installation instructions, and so on. If you are doing a
data analysis project instead of straight software engineering, a package with
some useful datasets and functions to work with them is a great goal to work
toward.

## Version Numbers

If your project is run like most, you're going to submit your work several times
over the course of the term. That means it's important for you to keep track of
exactly what version you're working on at any time, where it came from, and
where it's going.

The usual way to do this is with <span g="version_number">version
numbers</span>.  Most projects these days use <span
g="semantic_versioning">semantic versioning</span>, so when you see a number
like "6.2.3.1407" attached to a piece of software, it generally means:

-   major version 6

-   minor version 2

-   patch 3

-   build 1407

The major version number is only incremented when significant changes are
made. In practice, "significant" means "changes that make it impossible for
older versions to read the new version's data or configuration files". In
practice, major version numbers are often under the control of the marketing
department---if a competitor releases a new major version, we'd pretty much have
to as well.

Minor version numbers are what most people think of as releases. If you've added
a few new features, changed part of the GUI, etc., you increment the minor
version number so that your customers can talk intelligently about which version
they have.

Patches are things that don't have their own installers. If, for example, you
need to change one HTML form, or one DLL, you will often just mail that out to
customers, along with instructions about where to put it, rather than creating a
new installer. You should still give it a number, though, and make an entry in
your release log.

The build number is incremented every time you create a new version of the
product for QA to test. Build numbers are never reset, i.e. you don't go from
5.2.2.1001 to 6.0.0.0, but from 5.2.2.1001 to 6.0.0.1002, and so on. Build
numbers are what developers care about: they're often only matched up with
version numbers after the fact (i.e. you create build #1017, QA says, "It looks
good," so you say, "All right, this'll be 6.1.0," and voila, you have
6.1.0.1017.)

Finally, groups will sometimes identify pre-releases as "beta 1", "beta 2", and
so on, as in "6.2 beta 2". Again, this label is usually attached to a particular
build after the fact---you wait until QA (or whoever) says that build #1017 is
good enough to send out to customers, then tag it in version control.

A four-part numbering scheme is more than you need for an undergraduate
course. You can probably get away with just one: the assignment the software was
submitted for.

## Bugs

It's OK to have bugs in your code when you finish your project. After all,
almost all products have bugs in them when they ship. This isn't because
developers are lazy or careless; instead, it's a matter of economics. More than
half of first attempts to fix a problem contain bugs. That means that if you're
near the end of the development cycle, "fixing" a minor bug can actually
increase the chances of the program crashing or destroying users' data. It's
safer to document it (and a workaround, if any exists).

This is another way in which student projects differ from their industrial
counterparts. I have yet to see an instructor give students marks for cataloging
the bugs still in their code at the end of term, probably because it would be so
much work to mark. Instead, grades are often allocated based on a set of
automated pass/fail acceptance tests, and a subjective evaluation of the code's
quality (which usually means its conformance to basic rules of indentation,
commenting, and variable naming).

## The Final Report

The other thing student projects usually have to deliver is some kind of final
report. Most students short-change this part of the course, in part because it
comes at the end, but also because they think, "I want to write code, not a
novel." But here's Karl Fogel, author of <cite>Fogel2005</cite>, on writing:

> The ability to write clearly is perhaps the most important skill one can have
> in an open source environment. In the long run it matters more than
> programming talent. A great programmer with lousy communication skills can
> only get one thing done at a time, and even then may have trouble convincing
> others to pay attention. But a lousy programmer with good communication skills
> can coordinate and persuade many people to do many different things, and
> thereby have a significant effect on a project's direction and momentum.

End-of-project reports can range from half a dozen to fifty pages, depending on
the course's structure and the instructor's whims.  Regardless of their size,
they will usually include the following:

Title page, abstract, and table of contents.
:   The first identifies the document; the second summarizes it in three or four
    sentences, so that busy people can decide whether they ought to read the
    whole thing; and the third helps people navigate.

An introduction that orients the reader.
:   This explains what problem the team set out to solve, and summarizes any
    background knowledge needed to understand the team's solution.  It shouldn't
    state the obvious: there's no need to tell readers what the Internet is, or
    how a parser works. Instead, it should cover whatever general knowledge the
    *next* team will need in order to continue the project.

A summary of what was accomplished.
:   This should *not* simply rehash the A&E (<span x="process"></span>),
    although that's a good place to start. Instead, it should describe the
    system's architecture, any features of its data formats, class structure, or
    UI that won't immediately make sense to a knowledgeable observer, and so
    on. As with the introduction, the target audience is the next team to work
    on the project.

A summary of the current state of the project.
:   This should include high-level criticism ("The persistence layer works fine,
    but in retrospect, our concurrency control mechanism was a bad choice") and
    pointers to specifics ("Issue 213 should be addressed before any further
    work is done on user preferences").

An evaluation of the project.
:   What did the team learn about teamwork? What went well? What should they never
    do again?  Motherhood-and-apple-pie statements about the importance of
    version control don't belong here (or anywhere else). Instead, the team
    should conduct a proper post mortem and present as honest a summary of its
    findings as possible.

References.
:   Include books, papers, and links the team found helpful so that whoever
    inherits the project doesn't have to search for them again.

This report is neither a user's guide nor maintenance documentation. Instead, it
is like the end-of-contract reports I had to prepare when I was a consultant.
What had I done to earn my customers' money? What should the next person (who
might not be me) do? What could I tell them that would save them time? Internal
documentation (like Javadoc) doesn't help with these questions, and anyway, the
team should be producing that as they go along, not all in a rush at the end of
term.

So much for what the final report should include; how should you actually go
about writing it? It will probably include:

-   paragraphs of text;
-   equations;
-   source code;
-   vector graphics (such as graphs and line drawings); and
-   raster graphics (such as screen shots).

Lots of tools exist that will handle these, but they all have their flaws. You
can create your report as a set of wiki pages or Google Docs, but they don't
flag conflicts between concurrent authors.

On the other end of the spectrum are WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft Word and
OpenOffice. Unfortunately, these get in the way at least as much as they help:

1.  They store documents in non-text formats that version control systems can't
    diff or merge.

2.  It's hard to write scripts to process documents, so inclusions (such as code
    fragments) have to be done manually.

3.  Neither one handles equations very well (although both are getting better).

4.  It's very easy to format things using low-level primitives ("make this
    italic") rather than logical styles ("making this a book title"), which
    makes it difficult to keep the document consistent over time.

For these reasons, most teams format their reports as a set of Markdown pages
under version control and use a static site generator (<span
x="collaborate"></span>) to turn them into a report. That solves the problem of
multiple authors (HTML is a text format, so diff and merge will work), and if
you know a little CSS, you can make it look as pretty as you want. Diagrams and
screenshots work well, but equations are problematic: MathML (the mathematical
markup language) is complicated to write and poorly supported, so many people
still resort to embedding pictures of equations in web pages.

### XML and LaTeX

If you're really keen, you can use an XML markup format like DocBook, which
provides a set of semantically-meaningful tags like `<author>` and
`<citation>`. Various tools can then compile the XML into HTML, PDF, or other
formats. I've tried this, but have never been satisfied: it takes a lot of
typing to add all those tags, which makes DocBook feel like overkill for a
anything less than a legal document.

Then there's LaTeX, a markup language that's much more sophisticated than HTML,
and has literally thousands of add-on packages for equations, code formatting,
and just about everything else you could want. Like HTML, LaTeX is a text
format, so it plays nicely with version control.  However, its power comes at a
steep price: LaTeX is as hard to master as a programming language. It also has a
frustratingly slow formatting cycle, since documents have to be compiled into
PDF or another viewable format before you can see the effects of your changes
(although WYSIWYG tools like LyX are making great strides).

## The Post Mortem

The most valuable part of your project isn't the software you write, or the
grade you're given: it's the post mortem. Literally, this is an examination of a
deceased person; in a software project, it's a look back at what went right, and
what went wrong.

The aim of a post mortem is to help the team and its members do better next time
by giving everyone a chance to reflect on what they've just accomplished. It is
*not* to point the finger of shame at individuals, although if that has to
happen, the post mortem is the best place for it.

Post mortems are pretty easy to run---just add the following to the rules for
running a meeting:

Get a moderator who wasn't part of the project.
:   Someone who doesn't have a stake in the project should run the meeting.
    Otherwise, the meeting will either go in circles, or focus on only a subset
    of important topics. In the case of student projects, this moderator might
    be the course instructor, or (if the course is too large, or the instructor
    is lazy) a TA.

Set aside an hour, and *only* an hour.
:   In my experience, nothing useful is said in the first ten minutes of anyone's
    first post mortem, since people are naturally a bit shy about praising or
    damning their own work. Equally, nothing useful is said after the first
    hour: if you're still talking, it's probably because one or two people have
    a *lot* they want to get off their chests.

Require attendance.
:   Everyone who was part of the project ought to be in the room for the post
    mortem. This is more important than you might think: the people who have the
    most to learn from the post mortem are often least likely to show up if the
    meeting is optional.

Make two lists.
:   When I'm moderating, I put the headings "Keep" and "Change" on the board,
    then do a lap around the room and ask every person to give me one item that
    hasn't already been mentioned for each list.  The "hasn't already been
    mentioned" part is important: after the first few safe responses are up
    on the board, people have to start saying the more difficult things that
    really matter.

Comment on actions rather than individuals.
:   By the time the project is done, some people may not be able to stand one
    another. Don't let this sidetrack the meeting: if someone has a specific
    complaint about another member of the team, require him to criticize a
    particular event or decision. "He had a bad attitude" does *not* help anyone
    improve their game.

Once everyone's thoughts are out in the open, organize them somehow so that you
can make specific recommendations about what to do next time.  This list is one
of the two major goals of the post mortem (the other being to give people a
chance to be heard). For example, here are the recommendations that came out of
one post mortem I did with students:

1.  Do a better job of tracking actual progress, rather than reported
    progress. Maybe require a one-minute demo every time a feature is supposedly
    completed?

2.  Teams should find one block of 2--3 hours per week when they can work side
    by side: IM meetings and email resulted in a lot of dropped balls.

3.  Having someone who worked on the project in the previous term come in to get
    the new team up to speed made a huge difference.

4.  Team members should read each other's code, at least during the early stages
    of the project, to make sure everyone is actually following the coding
    guidelines.

5.  A large number of small commits is better than a small number of massive
    commits.

6.  Issue tracking system was too complicated for students' needs: really just
    want a shared online to-do list.

7.  Teams should have to report test coverage at every progress meeting to make
    sure that a lot of untested code doesn't pile up during the term.

## Ten Simple Rules for Handing Over and Moving On

Your course project will probably end when the course does, but you might decide
to carry on with it.  If you do, and if other people join in, you may eventually
decide that it's time for you to move over.  This advice is based on my
experience of doing that; see [this talk][carpentrycon-talk] for more detail.

1. Be sure you mean it.
:   Letting go will be hard on you, but not letting go will be even harder on your
    successors, so be sure you're actually going to let go.

2. Do it when other people think you should.
:   Just as you are the last person to realize when you're too tired to be coding,
    you will often be the last person to realize that you ought to be moving on, so
    ask people and pay attention to what they say.

3. Be open about what, when, and why.
:   Tell people that you're leaving and what the succession plan is as soon as
    possible, which in practice means "as soon as you think you won't have to revise
    what you have said publicly".

4. Leave for something.
:   People who start things usually aren't good with idleness, and idleness tends
    not to be good for them, so when you leave, leave *for* something, even if it's
    something small.

5. Don't choose your successor on your own.
:   You may have strong opinions about who should succeed you, but you should still
    check those opinions with someone more objective.

6. Train your successor.
:   Share tasks with your successor for a few days or weeks: they will get to see
    how things actually work, and you'll discover things you would otherwise forget
    to tell them.  Go on holiday for a week and leave your successor temporarily in
    charge.  You'll discover even more things you would otherwise forget to pass on.

7. Actually leave.
:   It may be tempting to continue to have a role in the organization, but that
    usually leads to confusion, since people are used to looking to you for answers.
    It will be easier for your successor, particularly if they weren't a founder as
    well, but the best thing you can do to help them is to find something else to do
    for a year.

8. Learn from your mistakes.
:   Whatever you have left will almost certainly not be the last thing you ever do.
    Take some time to think about what you could have done differently, write it
    down, and then move on: obsessing over only-ifs and might-have-beens won't help
    anyone.

9. Remember that they weren't all mistakes.
:   Many people are uncomfortable being praised, but give the organization a chance
    to celebrate what you accomplished and thank you for it.

10. Do something fun before you go.
:   There will never be a better time to try that wild idea that's been in the back
    of your mind for ages.
