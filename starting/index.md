Now that the really important stuff is out of the way, let's take a closer look
at undergraduate team programming projects.  On one side are homework
assignments, which typically include a handful of problems related to
recently-taught material that you are meant to solve in a week or two.  On the
other side are industrial internships or co-op terms in which you work full- or
part-time for a company, drawing a salary and suffering through quarterly
PowerPoint presentations on corporate strategy.  Lectures and exams usually
aren't a part of these, though if you're lucky (or if the company you're working
for knows what it's doing) you'll be paired with a mentor who will teach you
some of the things in these notes.

In between are courses with names like "Introduction to Software Engineering",
"Senior Thesis Project", or "Computer Science Capstone".  For the purposes of
this guide, these have three characteristics.  First, learning how to work in a
team is a goal of the course.  This distinguishes these courses from (for
example) upper-level courses in operating systems or computer graphics, in which
you're working in a team but not being taught explicitly how to do so.

Second, your grade depends primarily on the software you build.  You may also
be required to write reports and sit an exam, but these are based on the
practical work---if you don't actually build some software, you can't pass the
course.

Finally, you are supposed to work as if you were trying to meet the needs of a
real customer.  You might start with a blank sheet of paper or have to fix and
extend an existing application; either way, you and your team are responsible
for some or all of requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing,
documentation, packaging, deployment, handoff, and review.

## Why Projects?

Project courses exist for several reasons:

To teach you things that can only be learned by doing.
:   If you pursue a career in industry, or if you go stay in academia and do
    anything other than pure theory, you will need to know how to build things.
    This is a craft, not a science: you can't learn how by listening to lectures
    any more than you can learn to ride a bike by watching the Tour de France on
    TV.

To tie everything you've learned together,
:   i.e., to demonstrate that the trees and pointers and joins and semaphores
    you've been wrestling with for the last two or three years are actually good
    for something.

Because they're fun.
:   At least, if they're done right.

There are as many ways to run a project course as there are instructors teaching
them <cite>Fincher2001</cite>.  The most important variable is whether your team
has a real customer or not.  Finding and interviewing people who actually want
software built and then meeting their needs is tremendously rewarding.  However,
it's also a lot of work and puts an extra burden on the instructor as well.  For
this reason, most team projects tend to be made up by instructors.

A third option is to use an open source project as a starting point.  Whether
it's an audio editor, a tool for displaying family trees, or control software
for the latest generation of electronic toys, the odds are pretty good that
there are bugs to fix and features to add.  Working on a project like this is
easier than finding a local company that wants its web site rejigged.  It's also
an opportunity for you to meet other developers who can mentor you, and create
something you can show off in a job interview.

## Grades

The first step in any project (not just classroom projects) is to figure out
where the goalposts are, so you know which way to kick the ball.  If you're an
academic, this means finding something that is interesting and challenging
enough to be publishable, but not intractable.  In a startup, it means figuring
out what you can build that people will pay for.  Working for someone else?
Check your job description (including criteria for performance evaluation and
bonuses), and work accordingly.

Life's easier if you're a student: all you have to do is check the marking
scheme.  In a project course this typically has:

The software you produce.
:   Does it build and run? Does it meet the customer's requirements (or the
    instructor's specifications if you don't have a real customer)?  Is the
    source code readable?  Is the program efficient?  (Using an exponential
    algorithm instead of one that runs in linear time certainly *ought* to cost
    you marks…)

The process you followed.
:   Some instructors insist you use a traditional analyze-design-code-test
    methodology.  Others structure the course around short sprints (typically a
    couple of weeks long) during which you refactor the application, extend it,
    test your changes, and deploy the new version.  Since instructors can't
    watch over your shoulder while you're working, they can't actually grade you
    on whether or not you follow a prescribed process.  The best they can do is
    grade you on the artifacts that process is supposed to produce (discussed
    below).  Since these can always be created after the fact, it's very
    tempting to just put your head down and code.  Resist---any process is
    better than chaos, and sticking to what the instructor asked for will at
    least save arguments within the team.

A final report.
:   This may be a handoff report (i.e., documentation to help whoever inherits
    the software from you get up to speed), a summary of your experiences, or
    some combination.

A final exam.
:   This may focus on the theoretical side of the course ("Describe the four
    main functions of Quality Assurance…")  but smart instructors will include
    some questions to test your understanding of the project in order to
    determine who actually did the work and who was just along for the ride.

Just like real development projects, course projects can and should produce a
lot more than just code.  For example, <cite>Spinellis2007</cite> looked at how
much content of different kinds went into the FreeBSD project in 2006.  <span
t="starting-spinellis-stats"></span> doesn't divide "source code" into
"application code" and "tests", but it's still an eye-opener.

{% include table id="starting-spinellis-stats" file="spinellis-stats.tbl" cap="FreeBSD 2006" %}

Here are some of the things that you might be required to produce:

Requirements analysis
:   What the problem is, who the stakeholders are (i.e., who wants the problem
    solved), and what their needs are.

Design
:   What the user interface should look like, how data will flow through the
    system, what its major modules will be, and how they'll interact.

Application code
:   The software that will be delivered to the end user.  This is inextricably
    entangled with:

Test code
:   Coding and testing should not be separate activities: doing them
    concurrently greatly improves your project's chances of success.

Documentation
:   Human-readable explanations of the software's structure and use.  The first
    is intended for whoever inherits the software from you; the second, for its
    users.  It is almost always a mistake to try to combine the two or to write
    them as if they were going to be read by the same people.

Packaging
:   A program is a piece of software that runs for you on your machine.  A
    product is a piece of software that will run for anyone on *their* machine.
    Products take longer to build than programs: the packaging needed to let
    someone else download, install, configure, and run the program has often not
    been covered in software engineering courses, but good instructors will
    insist that you create it.

Deployment
:   These days the project's aim might not be to create something that can be
    downloaded and installed.  Instead, its aim might be to create a web site or
    web service or make something else directly available to users.  Like
    packaging, deployment can be a major development issue in its own right, and
    the effort required to do it is almost always underestimated.

Handoff
:   If you don't put effort into passing the project on to whoever comes after
    you, your hard work will almost certainly count for nought.  While it isn't
    usual for undergraduate projects to be handed on from one term to another,
    some courses require teams to swap code mid-term.  If this happens,
    instructors may grade you on how complete and up-to-date your wiki pages,
    bug database, and build scripts are at the time of handoff.

Review
:   The only way to get better at something is to reflect on how you've done and
    what you could have done better.  Every project should therefore end with a
    post mortem in which team members talk about what went right and what went
    wrong.  As mentioned earlier, this may then be the subject of the final
    report.

So much for generalities; the list below shows the grading scheme I've typically
used in project courses.

Warmup exercise (10%)
:   The warmup exercise is two weeks long; its purpose is to give students a
    chance to familiarize themselves with the problem domain, tools, and
    software they'll be using for the rest of the term.

Analysis and estimation (10%)
:   Two weeks spent figuring out what your customers actually want, what
    features will satisfy their needs, etc.

Code (10%)
:   Yes, that's right: the code is only worth 10% of the final grade, even
    though it's where students spend the bulk of their time.  I do this because
    (1) if you don't know how to program you shouldn't be in this course and (2)
    if you don't create some code you can't test, do a demo, or write your final
    report.

Testing (10%)
:   Testing is just as important as coding, so it's given the same weight.
    Note, though, that only automated tests count: if I can't check the
    project out of version control and re-run the tests (possibly after editing
    a configuration file) then as far as I'm concerned, the code hasn't been
    tested.  And it's no good saying, "But I can't write unit tests for my GUI"
    because it's simply not true: you can always test the core functionality,
    and if you design your program the right way tools like [Selenium][selenium]
    can test a lot more of your front end than you probably realize.

Demos (10%)
:   I used to require students to prepare a 20-minute lecture on a topic of
    their choosing and deliver it to their coursemates or a junior class.  It
    was a valuable experience, but it ate up a lot of time, so I switched to
    having students do 10-minute demos instead.  I usually give students two
    shots at this: one after which their peers give them feedback, and a second
    that's actually graded.  This is valuable practice for job interviews and a
    good reality check on how much progress has actually been made.

Teamwork (10%)
:   Everyone starts with 10 out of 10; marks come off if you always do your work
    at the last moment, check in code that breaks the build, or are
    disrespectful.

Final report (20%)
:   This describes the architecture of the code as it was actually built (rather
    than as it was designed) and summarizes the post mortem so that the next
    team can avoid any pitfalls this team ran into.

Final state of project (20%)
:   Most of my projects carry forward from term to term and team to team, so I
    award one fifth of the overall mark based on the state each team leaves the
    project in.  Does everything build?  Have issues been filed for all known
    bug?  Does the wiki explain how to install the code, and do those
    instructions actually work?

This grading scheme is labor-intensive: I probably spend 4--6 hours reading and
grading each project in a term.  I've thought several times about using peer
grading to reduce my load and give students some experience of what life is like
on the other side of the red pen, but I've never been able to convince myself
that it would actually work.

## Elevator Pitch

Once you know where the goalposts are, the next thing is to get everyone to
agree on what you're supposed to accomplish.  The best way to do this is write
an <span g="elevator_pitch">elevator pitch</span> like the one shown below to
figure out what problem you're trying to solve, who it affects, and why your
solution is a good one.

<blockquote>

**The problem of**
developing software in a predictable and reliable manner
**affects**
the management of software projects.
Developers are not able to predict reliably how long it takes them to complete tasks
which makes it impossible to effectively plan a project.
**As a result,**
users and managers are never sure whether the produced software will meet its requirements,
how reliable the software will be,
or whether the software will be delivered on time.
**A successful solution would**
help developers become more aware of what they do,
how they spend their time,
and the kinds of defects they find in their work.
**For**
software development teams
**who**
need to better understand how and when defects are introduced into their products,
**our product**
gathers and reports performance metrics
**in order to**
help developers track and analyze personal software development metrics.
**Unlike**
not gathering data or trying to gather it manually,
**our approach**
helps users gather data unobtrusively
and provides objective feedback that allows them to improve both individual and team performance.

</blockquote>

Have everyone on the team fill in the template independently and then compare
the results.  If your team is like most I've worked with, you'll be surprised by
how varied the answers are.  Once you have done that, pick one and turn it into
a short paragraph that everyone is happy with like the one below:

<blockquote>

Most programmers can't predict how long it will take them to do things because
they don't know how long previous tasks have taken.  Gathering data manually is
annoying enough that programmers won't do it, so we're building a tool that will
monitor what applications they use and how long they use them.  This feedback
will help them improve their working habits and allow them to give their
managers more accurate input for scheduling.

</blockquote>

You now have the first paragraph for your project's home page and the abstract
for your final report.

An alternative to writing an elevator pitch is to build the product's home page,
i.e., to make up the website for your software as if it already existed.  What
catchphrase would you put across the top to catch people's eyes?  What features
would you list on the back to make your software more appealing than its
competitors?  What would its system requirements be?  Its license?  Its price?
Once your team agrees on these things, you're ready to start designing and
coding.
